# Development of a ROS 2-Based Anomaly Detection Framework for Industrial Robots Using IMU Sensor Data and Gazebo Simulation
### Goal:
To develop a real-time anomaly detection system for industrial robots (e.g., UR3e) by generating IMU sensor data using Gazebo simulation, processing it through time-frequency analysis, and running detection models inside a ROS 2-based architecture.
